Sentimental analysis-Emotion Detection
# 💬 Sentiment Analysis Project

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project! This notebook explores how machine learning can be used to classify text sentiment — identifying whether a given piece of text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral emotion.

## 🎯 Objective
Build and evaluate a sentiment classification model using natural language processing techniques and supervised learning.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **NLTK / spaCy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

## 🧪 Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
2. **EDA:** Visualized sentiment distribution, frequent words, and review length patterns.
3. **Feature Extraction:** Used TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words models for text vectorization.
4. **Model Building:** Trained multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
5. **Evaluation:** Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

## 📌 Highlights
- Achieved over 90% accuracy with Logistic Regression.
- Word clouds reveal frequent positive and negative terms.
- ROC curves and classification reports added for performance evaluation.

## 🚀 Getting Started
To run this project:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells sequentially to explore the data and build the model.
